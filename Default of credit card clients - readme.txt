Default of credit card clientshttps://www.kaggle.com/mariosfish/default-of-credit-card-clientsDefault of credit card clients from UCI Machine Learning RepositoryContextThis notebook was created for analysis and prediction making of the Default of credit card clients Data Set from UCI Machine Learning Library. The data set can be accessed separately from the UCI Machine Learning Repository page, here.ContentIn their paper "The comparisons of data mining techniques for the predictive accuracy of probability of default of credit card clients. (Yeh I. C. & Lien C. H.,2009)", which can be found here, Yeh I. C. & Lien C. H. review six data mining techniques (discriminant analysis, logistic regression, Bayesclassifier, nearest neighbor, artificial neural networks, and classification trees) and their applications on credit scoring. Then, using the real cardholders’ credit risk data in Taiwan, they compare the classification accuracy among them.ModelsWe will create 3 models in order to make predictions and compare them with the original paper. These models are:Logistic RegressionDecision treeNeural NetworkAfter the initial predictions, each model will be "optimized" by GridSearchCV estimator, which will search for the best set of hyperparameters for every model.GoalUsing the models we created, we will try to predict the class value of dpnm column with better scores (accuracy and f1) than the scores presented in the original paper.
